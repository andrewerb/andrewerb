# andrewerb.com

My personal site, andrewerb.github.io or www.andrewerb.com

Hosted on Github pages! (If that wasn't obvious). Currently maintained in Bootstrap 3.

## This page is currently being redone in Bootstrap 4

I'm often working on it, so changes are ongoing. Currently planning to integrate a static site generator, migrate my personal/developer blog here, and upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to 4.
