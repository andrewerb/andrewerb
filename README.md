# [andrewerb.com](http://www.andrewerb.com)

My website, [andrewerb.com](www.andrewerb.com), V2.

Hosted on [Github pages](pages.github.com). Currently being rebuilt in [Bootstrap 4](getbootstrap.com).

This build is currently ongoing and in development. Stay tuned.

## Installation

- git clone or download this repo
- If you don't have it, download & install Yarn (or NPM)
- Install packages

## Run

In production, this site is run on GitHub Pages. To run locally, use a tool such as http-server (downloaded using npm install)
Run with npm start
"start": "http-server -p 8080",

## Future features to come

- Better SEO practices.
- Revised HTML markup (because I kind of know what I'm doing now).
- Static site generator.
- Updated libraries, such as FontAwesome 5.
- Better mobile styles and Nav.
- SCSS style revisions.
- Better build process.
- SVG failover.
- Blog migration to Github pages.
- Better package management & environment setup.
- All around nicer looking site and stuff. :sunglasses:
- Ellegant CSS loading animations & transitions.
- More features to come as well.
- Versioning! (For no significant reason).
- Slight and tedious shifts in color that nobody but Andrew will even care about.
- New fonts? Probably? Maybe?
- SSL encryption (which is not on a code level).
- Use of frontend precompiled build tools.
- Testing.
- Webpack

Expect much of this site to look the same. Just better and cleaner code for me to maintain, with slightly updated frontend tools.

## Whom this repo is for

This particular repo is primarily for myself, as I use github pages for hosting for my website. But of course, it's entirely publicly viewable for anybody's reference or curiosity.

:v: :wink:
