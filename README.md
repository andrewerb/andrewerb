# andrewerb.com

My personal site, andrewerb.github.io or www.andrewerb.com

Hosted on Github pages! (If that wasn't obvious). Currently maintained in Bootstrap 3.

I'm often working on it, so changes are ongoing. Currently planning to integrate a static site generator, migrate my personal/developer blog here, and upgrade from Bootstrap 3 to 4.
