My personal site, [andrewerb.com](www.andrewerb.com), V2.

Hosted on Github pages. Currently rebuilt in Bootstrap 4.

This build is currently ongoing and in development. Stay tuned.

## Future features to come

- Better SEO practices.
- Revised HTML markup (because I kind of know what I'm doing now).
- Static site generator.
- Updated libraries, such as FontAwesome4.
- Better mobile styles and Nav.
- SCSS revisions.
- SVG failover.
- Blog migration to Github pages.
- Better package management.
- All around nicer site and stuff. :sunglasses:
- Ellegant loading for CSS styles.
- More features to come as well.
- Versioning! (For no significant reason).
- Slight and tedious shifts in color that nobody but Andrew will even care about.
- New fonts? Probably? Maybe?
- SSL encryption (which is not on a code level).

Expect much of this site to look the same. Just better and cleaner code for me to maintain and slightly updated frontend tools.
